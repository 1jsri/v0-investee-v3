For example, if a stock trades at $100 and pays $4 in annual dividends, the yield is 4%. 

Key points about dividend yield:
- Higher yields aren't always better (could indicate a struggling company)
- Compare yields within the same industry
- Consider dividend growth alongside current yield
- Typical dividend yields range from 1-6% for most stocks`

Key concepts:
- Dividend Growth Rate: The annual percentage increase in dividends
- Dividend Aristocrats: S&P 500 companies with 25+ years of consecutive increases
- Dividend Kings: Companies with 50+ years of consecutive increases
- Compound growth: Reinvesting dividends can accelerate wealth building

Look for companies with:
- Strong cash flow generation
- Reasonable payout ratios (typically 40-60%)
- History of consistent increases
- Sustainable business models`

Understanding payout ratios:
- 0-40%: Conservative, room for growth
- 40-60%: Moderate, balanced approach
- 60-80%: Higher, less room for increases
- 80%+: Potentially unsustainable

Different industries have different norms:
- Utilities: Often 60-80% (stable cash flows)
- Tech: Often 20-40% (growth focus)
- REITs: Required to pay out 90%+ of income

A sustainable payout ratio is crucial for dividend reliability.`

Types of REITs:
- Equity REITs: Own and operate income-producing real estate
- Mortgage REITs: Finance real estate through mortgages
- Hybrid REITs: Combination of both

Benefits:
- High dividend yields (often 4-8%)
- Real estate exposure without direct ownership
- Professional management
- Liquidity (can trade like stocks)

Considerations:
- Interest rate sensitivity
- Different tax treatment (ordinary income rates)
- Sector concentration risk
- Economic cycle sensitivity`

Types of Dividends:
- Qualified Dividends: Taxed at capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20%)
- Ordinary Dividends: Taxed at regular income rates (up to 37%)

To qualify for preferential tax treatment:
- Must be from U.S. corporations or qualified foreign companies
- Must hold stock for required holding periods
- REITs typically pay ordinary dividends

Tax-Advantaged Accounts:
- 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA: Dividends grow tax-deferred or tax-free
- Taxable accounts: Consider tax implications in planning

Tax strategies vary by individual situation, so consult with a tax professional for personalized advice.`
